What research has been done?
:::

A great deal of research has focused on what to teach in data science courses, but little focus on *how* students learn data science concepts.

. . .

</br>

Thus far we have detailed...

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
-  concepts or competencies that ought to be included in data science programs

- perspectives on when to teach data science

- how to teach data science concepts

- methods for integrating data science into the classroom

- assorted topics to be considered in data science courses

::: notes
While these reports are useful, it is important to understand how these
recommendations translate into student learning. Teaching data science
effectively is more than identifying end goals and developing a novel curriculum. Effective teaching demands an understanding of the perspective of the learner and how they make sense of information and write computing code in the process of learning. 

The discipline of data science education shares a great deal of similarities with that of CS education; namely, the important role students’ code plays in their learning. Thus, the discipline of data science education stands to learn from how CS education researchers investigate the student learning in the context of the code they produce.

-   Particularly relevant to describing the processes of human actions
    -   can be "strategic, routine, random, novel, automatic, and / or thoughtful" [@corbin, p. 247].
-   Can be intertwined with time, such that actions can emerge, change, or occur in particular sequences.
